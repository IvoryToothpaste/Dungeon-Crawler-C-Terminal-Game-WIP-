# Dungeon-Crawler-C-Terminal-Game-WIP-
Honestly just messing around.

Dungeon Crawler is a C++ terminal game, that is in development whenever I feel like it

The goal is to build a game with the following mechanics

Inventory
Turn based battle
Basic exploration
Overworld and Dungeon maps
Leveling
Social interactions with NPCs

Whatever :)
